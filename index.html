         <h6>Can´t read me.Santa Claus is originally from Saint Nicholas until America reframe Santa Claus.
              St Nicholas is from a very rich family and his parents died when he was young.
               He used the money to give gifts to the newborn baby and kids in the area,
                just like the magi gave the gifts to Joseph and Mary when Jesus was born. 
             That is why they use Santa Claus for christmas (which celebrate The Born of Jesus Christ).</h6>
